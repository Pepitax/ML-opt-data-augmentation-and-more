# ML-opt-data-augmentation-and-more

###**Description**
We explore the impact of different optimizers and varying sub-training dataset sizes to identify the most effective optimizer for tasks involving limited data.  
Subsequently, we apply data augmentation techniques to these small datasets to evaluate improvements in classification accuracy.  

###**Organization of files**
The main file containing all our plots and results : **run.ipynb**
- First part of the notebook : optimizer performance exploration & loss landscapes with PCA (to give some insights)
- Second part of the notebook: - call all the .py files of data augmentation. Each .py train the network with different data augmentation techniques (flip, crop, etc)
                               - call
